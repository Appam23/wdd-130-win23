        <h1>Our heritage</h1>
        	Since my childhood I can mostly understand people based on their facial expression.<br> 
        Now, I know how to take a good picture of a person’s visage. Thus, taking professional <br>
        pictures and making videos are one of my favorite pastimes up till now. This time, I finally<br>
        found an opportunity to create my own photography website, and I want this web page to be <br>
        focused on people who cannot afford to go and see the different parts of the world. For instance,<br>
        it’s very hard for people such as senior citizens and financially poor Americans to go and see the<br>
        different cultures, food habits and breathtaking historical monuments like the “Taj Mahal” in India;<br> 
        unless he/she is from a wealthy family or has lots of savings in the bank, it’s out of the question <br>
        to catch sight of or spot the beauty of another world. However, it will be feasible to perceive through<br> 
        my website, though the person may not physically be present. In this site the viewers will be able to <br>
        see how the human ability or their hard work withoutany modern machine, can build an extraordinary<br>
        and magnificent memorial buildings.

        <h1>Multiculturalism</h1>
        The cultural diversities of my country India, it has more than two thousand ethic groups<br>
        out of these only seven hundred five are officially recognized. And the aim of this website<br>
        is to show cast all the possible image of the divergent culture, their ways of lives and conduct<br>
        of societies without the influence of modern civilization. For instance, in the northeastern India<br>
        a state called Manipur has three major ethnic groups, the Meitei’s in the valley, the Nagas and the <br>
        kuki-chin tribes in the hills. Even though they live in the same place and environment, the way they <br>
        conduct some ceremonial function e.g marriage is totally different, the uniqueness of certain communities<br>
        is what this website trying to capture and express aside from assumption, in other words revealing the<br>
        genuineness of mankind. This site will offer the beauty and sereness of humanity. For those who are not able <br>
        to go and see or meet face to face, watching from this site will give them a genuine satisfactory feelings because<br>
        of its originality/unfake of the pictures. As it says, “Eyes are the windows to the souls”. The main purpose of this <br>
        webpage is to connect the souls of the audience to the portrait by immersing into it and perceiving the joys of other <br>
        traditions and heritage without physically present there.

        <h1>Health Nourishment</h1>
        This photography network is to share the uniqueness of my country India, <br>
        which includes different in foods and environment. The idea of my website <br>
        is to motivate the people who are exhausted because of living in the same habitat and<br>
        willing to explore different side of the world. The webpage is about real and actuality<br>
        of people living in different surrounding or mother nature. For instance, the Americans <br>
        lives in the world where most of the food are packed and ready for breakfast, lunch, and <br>
        dinner anytime they want to have it. But, in the Indian village it takes an hour to prepare <br>
        a meal and fed our hungry stomach. It may find boring to see this site at the beginning<br>
        but, if the onlookers caught the real intention and massage, they will love it as it’s all<br>
        about authenticity, how individual survive, and a community lives together to share their talents<br>
        and strength. And what do their family consume daily to keep physically fit and to stay alive.
