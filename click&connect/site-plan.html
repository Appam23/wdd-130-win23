        <h1>Our heritage</h1>
        <p>	Since my childhood I can mostly understand people based on their facial expression.
        Now, I know how to take a good picture of a person’s visage. Thus, taking professional
        pictures and making videos are one of my favorite pastimes up till now. This time, I finally
        found an opportunity to create my own photography website, and I want this web page to be 
        focused on people who cannot afford to go and see the different parts of the world. For instance,
        it’s very hard for people such as senior citizens and financially poor Americans to go and see the
        different cultures, food habits and breathtaking historical monuments like the “Taj Mahal” in India; 
        unless he/she is from a wealthy family or has lots of savings in the bank, it’s out of the question 
        to catch sight of or spot the beauty of another world. However, it will be feasible to perceive through 
        my website, though the person may not physically be present. In this site the viewers will be able to 
        see how the human ability or their hard work withoutany modern machine, can build an extraordinary
        and magnificent memorial buildings. In addition, this site will show the various cultures of 
        Indian and their eating habits.

      <h3>Cultures(child-page-1)</h3>
      
        <h1>Multiculturalism</h1>
        <p> The cultural diversities of my country India, it has more than two thousand ethic groups
        out of these only seven hundred five are officially recognized. And the aim of this website
        is to show cast all the possible image of the divergent culture, their ways of lives and conduct
        of societies without the influence of modern civilization. For instance, in the northeastern India
        a state called Manipur has three major ethnic groups, the Meitei’s in the valley, the Nagas and the 
        Kuki-chin tribes in the hills. Even though they live in the same place and environment, the way they 
        conduct some ceremonial function e.g marriage is totally different, the uniqueness of certain communities
        is what this website trying to capture and express aside from assumption, in other words revealing the
        genuineness of mankind. This site will offer the beauty and sereness of humanity. For those who are not able 
        to go and see or meet face to face, watching from this site will give them a genuine satisfactory feeling because
        of its originality/unfaked of the pictures. As it says, “Eyes are the windows to the souls”. The main purpose of this 
        webpage is to connect the souls of the audience to the portrait by immersing into it and perceiving the joys of other 
        traditions and heritage without physically present there.

      <h3>Cuisine(child-page-1)</h3>
      
        <h1>Health Nourishment</h1>
        <p> This photography network is to share the uniqueness of my country India, 
        which includes different in foods and environment. The idea of my website 
        is to motivate the people who are exhausted because of living in the same habitat and
        willing to explore different side of the world. The webpage is about real and actuality
        of people living in different surrounding or mother nature. For instance, the Americans
        lives in the world where most of the food are packed and ready for breakfast, lunch, and 
        dinner anytime they want to have it. But, in the Indian village it takes an hour to prepare 
        a meal and fed our hungry stomach. It may find boring to see this site at the beginning
        but, if the onlookers caught the real intention and massage, they would love it as it’s all
        about authenticity, how individual survive, and a community lives together to share their talents
        and strength. And what do their family consume daily to keep physically fit and to stay alive.
